Welcome to Auto3D's documentation!
==================================

.. note::

   This documentation is under active development.

**Auto3D** is a Python package for generating low-energy conformers from SMILES/SDF. It automatizes the stereoisomer enumeration and duplicate filtering process, 3D building process, fast geometry optimization and ranking process using ANI and AIMNet neural network atomistic potentials. Auto3D can be imported as a Python library, or be excuted from the terminal.
